# Mental Health in Tech Industry
Author: Aboli Moroney <br>
Timeline: 03-Nov-2020 to 15-Dec-2020

## Motivation

In January 2020, I commited to spend time on learning about and sensitizing my network of people about Mental Health and Emotional Well-being. People entering or already working the tech industry are leading increasingly stressful lives and working in highly competitive environments. In this lifestyle, self care and mental health often takes a backseat until it becomes a major medical issue. When I read the [blogs posts by OSMI](https://osmihelp.org/about/blog), I learnt several interesting facts that piqued my curiousity to perform this exploratory analysis using the survey data they published. I strongly feel that spreading awareness about Mental Health issues is a pressing need in our community and I would like to supplement my limited knowledge with scientific research.

## Purpose

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis on Mental Health at workplaces in Tech Industry. It uses the survey results from 2019 published by OSMI. This project is a capstone project for the Data 512 A Human Centered Data Science course in the MS Data Science program at University of Washington.

## Data Source
The data used to perform this exploration is an open source dataset published by [Open Sourcing Mental Illness](https://osmihelp.org/about/about-osmi), a non-profit, 501(c)(3) corporation dedicated to raising awareness, educating, and providing resources to support mental wellness in the tech and open source communities. The [survey results from 2019](https://osmihelp.org/research) contain responses from over 350 participants to 82 questions. This survey was conducted to measure attitudes towards mental health in the tech workplace, and examine the frequency of mental health disorders among tech workers. The dataset can be [downloaded from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/osmihelp/osmi-mental-health-in-tech-survey-2019)

## Analysis
The key research areas of this project are as follows:
- How does the perception of mental health vary across gender, age, race, ethnicity, location, etc.?
- What are the provisions at tech workplaces to address mental health issues in employees?

The detailed exploratory data analysis, code, graphs, insights and observations can be found in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/abolim/data-512-final/blob/master/2-Analysis/EDA%20-%20Mental%20Health%20in%20Tech.ipynb).
