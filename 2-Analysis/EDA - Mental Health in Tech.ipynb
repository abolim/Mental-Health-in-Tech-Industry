    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of every year, I pledge to contribute to 2 or 3 social issues that I deeply care about to give back to the community. In January 2020, I commited to spend time on learning about and sensitizing my network of people about 2 such causes - **Zero Waste** and **Emotional Well-being and Mental Health**. I strongly feel that spreading awareness about Mental Health issues is a pressing need and I would like to supplement my posts on social media forums with scientific research. \n",
    "Thus, for the capstone project for the human centered data science course, I would like to use data to explore how people in the tech industry are affected by mental health issues and how they react to such issues. This research is important to me as it is a growing concern in our community and I am curious to understand how it is being addressed in the tech industry. \n"

    "\n",
    "People entering or already working the tech industry are increasingly leading stressful lives and working in highly competitive environments. In this lifestyle, self care and mental health often takes a backseat until it becomes a major issue. When I read the blogs posts by OSMI [here](https://osmihelp.org/about/blog), I learnt several interesting facts that piqued my curiousity to perform this analysis. Below are some references to the some very hard-hitting quotes and facts: <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "**How does the perception of mental health vary across gender, age, race, ethnicity, location, etc.?**\n",
    "    - Are mental health issues more prevalent in the youth or mid-age? \n",
    "    - Are people of minority race/ethnicity more affected by mental illness? \n",
    "    - Are men less expressive about mental health problems compared to females? Are they affected equally? \n",
    "    - Are mental health issues discussed more in the developed nations?\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the provisions at tech workplaces to address mental health issues in employees?**\n",
    "    - Are there any reservations in discussing these issues with coworkers or employers and seeking help?\n",
    "    - Are employers providing healthcare benefits for mental health issues?\n",
    "    - How many respondents are have experienced mental health problems or are currently being diagnosed?\n",
    "    - How do employers weigh mental health issues at the same level as to other medical issues?\n",
    "    - Are there any leave policies for those suffering from mental health issues?\n",

I intend to use responses for some of the survey questions to perform my explorations. I am especially intrigued to use this dataset as it contains a lot of categorical variables and will be an ethnographic study to understand the behaviour of the respondents.
